# Dam Game With Java

#### This Dam game was developed using java and the JavaFX framework. The game includes all of the rules and features of the game and proper handling of the game behaviors using an underlying game model. All game processing is done through this game model, so the game model is the core part of the game. The user interface that which player used to play the game, is only handling user actions and passes to the game model for processing and fetching game outputs. Also, the user-interface graphics parameters can change using game settings such as game board color, size, disk colors, disk size, etc..![damjava1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85817726/182601612-de0269f6-d379-48a9-8bd6-dcabdb091cdb.png)
